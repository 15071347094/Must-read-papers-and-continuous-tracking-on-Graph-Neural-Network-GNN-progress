# Must-read papers and continuous tracking on Graph Neural Network(GNN) progress

Many important real-world applications and questions come in the form of graphs, such as social networks, protein-interaction networks, brain network, chemical molecular graph and 3D point cloud. Therefore, driven by interdisciplinary research, the neural network model for graph-oriented data has become an emerging research hotspot.


This project focuses on GNN, lists relevant must-read papers and keeps track of progress.  We look forward to promoting this direction and providing some help to researchers in this direction.
